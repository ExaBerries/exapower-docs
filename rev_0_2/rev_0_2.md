Something seems flawed with the current sensing, massive oscillations on cspx causing per phase ocp to trigger extemely low even when set to max possible. Since it can't even run a 9600 gt its not very useful. Rev 0.3 is only a few small changes but works better.

Similar div resistor option as in rev 0.1
